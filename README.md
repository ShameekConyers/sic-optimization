## Installation Instructions.

You'll have to compile it yourself as I wrote this on a M1 mac, but since no
libraries were used if you have CMake installed you can cd to the root
directory of this project and run

```shell
	./run_prod.sh
```

And it will run and output the corresponding data, If you just want to build but
not run you can use the CMakeLists.txt to build it yourself
